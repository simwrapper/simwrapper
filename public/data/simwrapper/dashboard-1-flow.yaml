  title: "Effect of AVs on flow capacity"
  description:  >
      This dashboard shows the effect of conventional vehicles (CV), automated vehicles (AV) and highly autonomous vehicles (ACV) on flow capacity, i.e. the potential throughput of vehicles.
      We modeled the driving behaviour microscopically in SUMO and evaluated the resulting flow capacity for intersections and free flow sections in the study area.
      Three different scenarios with varying vehicle share and capabilities are presented and compared."
