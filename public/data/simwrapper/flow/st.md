In the near future, traffic will still consist predominantly of conventional vehicles <span style="color:red">(CVs)</span>.
We modeled a share of 70% conventional vehicles without any driving assistance systems at intersections.

The rest of the traffic consist of automated vehicles <span style="color:green">(AVs)</span>, that can to some degrees operate without driver intervention.
The driving style of the vehicle is still very defensively at this point, more defensive than most human driver would behave.
In the simulation this is parametrized by larger time headway and strict traffic rule abidance.
