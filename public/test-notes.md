## MATSim-Episim Version 7: Re-opening Scenarios

**TEST NOTES!**

_Published 22 April 2020_

Here we depict the effects of reopening society at various levels for work, school, leisure and other activities.

- Simulations are for **Berlin**, **Munich**, and **Heinsberg** regions (each city plus some surroundings).
- Real-world infections are from [Robert Koch Institute (RKI)](https://npgeo-corona-npgeo-de.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/dd4580c810204019a7b8eb3e0b329dd6_0). For many cases, a delay between infection and reporting may occur.
- For Berlin and Munich, the following activity restrictions are included:
  - After **March 13**, 10% of leisure acts are banned (corresponding to the closure of theaters, etc.). Also, schools / kindergarten / universities are closed. 10 percent of kita and primary-aged children still go to kita / primary schools (Notbetrieb).
  - On **March 23**, work, shopping, errands and business are reduced, corresponding to the currently valid "Kontaktsperre"; the percentage of work, leisure, shopping, errands and business activities still occuring after **March 23** can be set.
  - Educational facilities can be reopened on **April 20**.

[Google COVID-19 Mobility report](https://google.com/covid19/mobility) shows for Berlin after March 23:

- retail & recreation down by about 70% (i.e. at about **30%**)
- grocery & pharmacy down by about 20% (i.e. at about **80%**)
- parks down by about 20% (i.e. at about **80%**)
- workplace down by about 40% (i.e. at about **60%**)
  Other than google, we do not take the last day, but take visual averages over about a week.

The best approximation to this with our options below would be:

- **leisure** at **20%** (with the assumption that parks do not contribute that much to infections)
- **work** at **60%**
- **shopping** at **40%**
- **errands & business** at **40%**

If one assumes that the capacity of the Berlin system for critical COVID cases is about 1000, then one finds that there is scant little room to relax restrictions.

Or alternatively: The currently "blunt" restrictions would need to be replaced by something smarter.
