The interaction between connected automated vehicles (CAVs) and smart infrastructure, is likely to result in increased capacity for existing road infrastructure.

However, this may lead to a rebound effect, as has been shown in the study by **(TODO: citation)**, where, public transport users are enticed to take up the excess capacity, resulting in similar travel times as had been in the study area before.

Luckily, the technology need not be at odds with the objectives of city planners and traffic operators, as it enables a number of countervailing strategies to fine-tune its deployment as there is increasing uptake.

These dashboards explore possible strategies that will form part of a new and evolving toolbox for planners and traffic operations. In each case, an example scenario was simulated in MATSim and compared with a baseline case.

### Corridor deployment & road space reclamation
The first set of scenarios explore a possible mode of deployment, by creating a corridor along which smart infrastructure has been installed, exploring its impact under various combinations of conditions on the commuter experience.

The corridor is used as an example case for one strategy to counter rebound effects on mode choice - to claim back road space for other purposes. Be it to widen sidewalks, build cycling lane infrastructure or to be used as community space, our example demonstrates that, under certain assumptions regarding the increase in traffic flow capacity, removing a lance from links with more than one lane along a corridor can still result in performance at least as good as the base case.
