Given the defined scenario as above, we obtain the following average capacities changes at intersections:

|                         | Short-term &nbsp; | Mid-term  &nbsp;| Long-term  &nbsp; |
|-------------------------|--------------|------------|------------|
|  Mean capacity change   |    97%       |   114%     |   159%     |


The figure shows that the increase for right/left turning vehicles is lower than for vehicles driving straight ahead.
Due to the defensively driving vehicles we can even see a slight decrease assuming the given shares.


In the urban areas intersections are the main limiting factor.
Nonetheless, the next figures show that the results are structurally similar if we look free flowing traffic.

The figure shows the relative flow capacity change compared to the base scenario aggregated over all studied relations.
The data is additionally separated by whether a relation requires a turning maneuver.
